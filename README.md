## Overview

DART enables:
- alignment of cell stained slices to a 3D common coordinate framework
- automatic and manual annotation of brain regions
- excision of identified brain regions with LEICA software


## Installation

DART is distributed as a pre-compiled Windows binary in a standalone folder that includes all necessary dependencies. To use the software, download and extract the entire folder from the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZ8UNjqNX_7eInwqjmnIVMsgPvRFYCfx?usp=drive_link), then run the `main.exe` file insideâ€”no installation or separate Python environment is required.

### Installation using pip

This installation method is intended for users who sets up a Python environment without `pipenv`.

```
pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/STalign.git" <---- change this
```

*All dependencies will be installed into your selected environment with the above command. Dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt file.*

### Installation using Pipfile from source

This installation method is intended for users who sets up a Python environment with `pipenv`. `pipenv` allows users to create and activate a virtual environment with all dependencies within the Python project. For more information and installation instructions for `pipenv`, see https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/.

Fork and `git clone` the `STalign` github repository.

From the base directory of your local `STalign` git repo, create a `Pipfile.lock` file from `Pipfile` using:

```
pipenv install requests
```

## Input Data
To use this tool, you will need provide the following information:

- 3D Reference Atlas with cell stain and region annotations(not needed if using Allen Brain Atlas)
- Cell stained images from LEICA LDM on slides 

## Usage

To use `DART`, please refer to our [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ch9BTZmZ5squiQciajM1lAMXQOpW5biJrctP5JFD_R4/edit?usp=sharing).
