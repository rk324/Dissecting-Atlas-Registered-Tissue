## Overview

DART enables:
- alignment of cell stained slices to a 3D common coordinate framework
- automatic and manual annotation of brain regions
- excision of identified brain regions with LEICA software


## Installation

DART is distributed as a pre-compiled Windows binary in a standalone folder that includes all necessary dependencies. To use the software, download and extract the entire folder from the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZ8UNjqNX_7eInwqjmnIVMsgPvRFYCfx?usp=drive_link), then run the `main.exe` file insideâ€”no installation or separate Python environment is required.

## Input Data
To use this tool, you will need provide the following information:

- 3D Reference Atlas with cell stain and region annotations(not needed if using Allen Brain Atlas)
- Cell stained images from LEICA LDM on slides 

## Usage

To use `DART`, please refer to our [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ch9BTZmZ5squiQciajM1lAMXQOpW5biJrctP5JFD_R4/edit?usp=sharing).
